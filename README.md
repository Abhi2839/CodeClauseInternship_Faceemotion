Face Emotion Detection 🎭

This project is part of my 2nd internship at CodeClause. It focuses on detecting human emotions from facial expressions using a combination of Haar Cascade Algorithm (for face detection) and DeepFace Library (for emotion recognition).

The system can currently analyze static images and identify emotions such as:

😀 Happiness

😢 Sadness

😡 Anger

😲 Surprise

😐 Neutral

😨 Fear

🤢 Disgust

🚀 Next step: Extending this into a real-time emotion detection system using live video feed.

🔧 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

OpenCV (Haar Cascade for face detection)

DeepFace (for emotion classification)

Matplotlib (for visualization)
